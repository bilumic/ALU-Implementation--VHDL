# ALU-Implementation--VHDL
In this project, we implemented an ALU unit. The system receives two input vectors and an operation code, determining which calculation to perform. It consists of three submodules: ADD/SUB, SHIFTER, and LOGIC. The output includes the calculation result and four flags: N (negative), C (carry), V (overflow), and Z (zero).
